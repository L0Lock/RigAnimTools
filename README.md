# RiggingTools

RiggingTools is an add-on for Blender regrouping some little tools I made for myself to automate redundant tasks (isn't that what programs are made for in the first place ?).

# List of tools

**Set Inverse Child Of**
 In pose mode, used for setting the inverse of every "Child Of" constraint in the armature.
